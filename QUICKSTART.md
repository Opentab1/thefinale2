# Pulse 1.0 - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Running in 5 Minutes

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB recommended)
- Fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
- Internet connection
- Display, keyboard, mouse (for initial setup)

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Open Terminal

On your Raspberry Pi, open a terminal window.

### Step 2: Run Installation Command

Copy and paste this single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Opentab1/thefinale2/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

⏱️ **Installation takes ~15-20 minutes**

What it does:
- ✓ Updates system packages
- ✓ Installs dependencies
- ✓ Sets up Pulse software
- ✓ Configures services
- ✓ Tests hardware
- ✓ Reboots system

### Step 3: Complete Setup Wizard

After reboot, **wait 30-60 seconds** for the system to start services.

The setup wizard will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:9090`.

**If you see a white screen with only a cursor:**
- **Quick fix:** Press `ESC`, then navigate to `http://localhost:9090` in the browser
- **Alternative:** Press `Ctrl+Alt+F2`, login as `pi`, run:
  ```bash
  pkill chromium
  export DISPLAY=:0
  /opt/pulse/dashboard/kiosk/start.sh
  ```
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed recovery steps

**If the wizard doesn't appear:**
- Wait a bit longer (services take time to start on first boot)
- Manually open Chromium browser and go to `http://localhost:9090`
- Check if wizard service is running: `sudo systemctl status pulse-firstboot.service`

**Fill in the wizard:**
1. **Venue name** (e.g., "Joe's Bar")
2. **Timezone** (select from dropdown)
3. **Hardware check** (shows detected sensors - click Next)
4. **Smart integrations** (skip if you don't have them yet)
5. **Automation limits** (use defaults or customize)

Click **"Complete Setup"** → System reboots again

### Step 4: Dashboard Auto-Launches

After the second reboot, the dashboard opens automatically at `http://localhost:8080`.

**Wait 30-60 seconds** for services to start.

**You're done!** 🎉

💡 **Tip:** If you see a blank screen after either reboot, press `Ctrl+Alt+F2` to access the terminal and check service status with `sudo systemctl status pulse-*`

## Common First-Time Questions

### Q: Can I use Pulse without smart home devices?
**A:** Yes! Pulse works great with just the sensors. You'll get occupancy tracking, environmental monitoring, and analytics.

### Q: What if a sensor isn't detected?
**A:** Pulse automatically disables it and continues working. You can add sensors later without reinstalling.

### Q: How do I add Nest/Hue/Spotify later?
**A:** Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → Enter credentials → Save

### Q: Can I turn off automation?
**A:** Yes! Click the **Safe Mode** button (top right) to disable all automation instantly.

### Q: How do I exit kiosk mode?
**A:** Press **ESC** key to exit fullscreen. Press **F11** to re-enter.
